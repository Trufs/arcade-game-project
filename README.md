# Arcade Game Project
A version of the classic 'Frogger' game: player has to get across the street while avoiding the bugs. The game can be useful for training reaction speed.


### Prerequisites
The game can be run in any browser which supports ES6 and HTML5 canvas.


### Installing
No instalation is needed. All you need to do is open the index.html file in your browser.


## Instructions
You can move the character by using arrows (left, right, up, down). At the beginning of the game, the character is placed on the bottom of the screen, on the grass panels. Your task is to get safely across the street (three rows of the rock panels above) and into water (the top row). Once you reach the water, new level is triggered and the character's position resets.

Enemies
The malicious red bugs moving on the street are your enemies. Try to avoid them! If you collide with one of them, the level is reset and the character is transported to its starting position. You also lose 1-3 gems from your collection.
Enemies speed will increase every time when you reach a new level.

Gems
There will be some orange gems on the road. Try to collect them! Once you've found a gem, it gets added to your gem collection and improves your boasting capabilities.

Winning the game
You win when you decide you have enough levels and gems to satisfy your needs. Congratulations!
